# Quiz

# Discription
Create a Timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals, along with HTML for markup and CSS for styling. The quiz should have a start button that initiates the quiz when clicked, starting a countdown timer. The user should be presented with a series of random Anime-related questions.

For each incorrectly answered question, time should be subtracted from the remaining time. The user should be able to gauge their progress based on the remaining time.

Once all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game should end. At this point, the user should be able to save their initials and score. Currently, the high scores are stored using local storage.

In the future, there are plans to expand the functionality of the quiz by reworking the local storage system to accommodate more user inputs.
